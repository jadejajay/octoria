3. Convert to Other Color Space: This algorithm is used to convert an image from one color space to another, such as converting RGB to YCbCr or vice versa.
4. Segmentation: This algorithm is used to divide an image into segments or regions, such as separating foreground and background.
5. Morphological Operations: This algorithm is used to perform operations on images using morphology, such as erosion, dilation, and opening/closing.
6. Transforms: This algorithm is used to transform an image from one domain to another, such as from the spatial domain to the frequency domain or vice versa.
