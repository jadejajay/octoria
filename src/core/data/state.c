// Basic Probability:
// Experiment, definition of probability, conditional probability, independent
// events, Bayes' rule, Bernoulli trials, Random variables, discrete random
// variable, probability mass function, continuous random variable,
// probability density function, cumulative distribution function, properties
// of cumulative distribution function, Two dimensional random variables
// and their distribution functions, Marginal probability function,
// Independent random variables.

// Some special Probability Distributions:
// Binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, Poisson approximation to the
// binomial distribution, Normal, Exponential and Gamma densities,
// Evaluation of statistical parameters for these distributions.

// Basic Statistics:
// Measure of central tendency: Moments, Expectation, dispersion,
// skewness, kurtosis, expected value of two dimensional random variable,
// Linear Correlation, correlation coefficient, rank correlation coefficient,
// Regression, Bounds on probability, Chebyshevâ€˜s Inequality

// Applied Statistics:
// Formation of Hypothesis, Test of significance: Large sample test for single
// proportion, Difference of proportions, Single mean, Difference of means,
// and Difference of standard deviations.
// Test of significance for Small samples:
// t- Test for single mean, difference of means, t-test for correlation
// coefficients, F- test for ratio of variances, Chi-square test for goodness of
// fit and independence of attributes.

// Curve fitting by the numerical method: Curve fitting by of method of least
// squares, fitting of straight lines, second degree parabola and more general
// curves.
